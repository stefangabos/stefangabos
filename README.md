### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Stefan Gabos, a web developer working from Bucharest, Romania. I'm half Hungarian, stubborn, articulate, and slightly afraid of women.

I started coding when I was around 14 (that's way back in 1994), and I am extremely passionate about it. I started coding in BASIC and then went on with Assembler and Turbo Pascal. In 1997 I started developing commercial applications using Microsoft Access. Since 2001 I'm developing exclusively for the web using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

I am an incurable workaholic and a perfectionist. I work with PHP, MySQL, HTML and CSS and JavaScript and have been using these things since back when GeoCities was the most visited website on the Internet and the `<blink>` tag was cool. I am among the 6 people in the world who were never afraid of Internet Explorer 6.

I develop rock-solid PHP libraries and super-lightweight, highly optimized, bad-ass jQuery plugins and open-source them because I am a web developer even when I'm not at work. 

According to [Git Awards](http://git-awards.com/users/search?login=stefangabos) I am among the top developers in the world :)

When working, I listen to massive amounts of music â€“ alternative rock, in general. When I am not working (it sometimes happens), I enjoy playing the guitar, sleeping, cooking, watching Formula One or a good movie.
